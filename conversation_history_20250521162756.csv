The amount of spice is up to you, but know that a little red chile lends immeasurable flavor in addition to heat. If your ginger root is especially young and tender, consider peeling then cutting it into fine 1-inch matchsticks to eat in the soup for an even deeper, punchier warmth. White beans offer protein in this brothy meal, which becomes even heartier with the addition of white rice or noodles. (You can also sop it up with a slice of cornbread.) Reheat this nourishing soup throughout the week, adding more broth and various crisper-drawer vegetables you need to use up, like cabbage, kale, arugula, watercress and bean sprouts. Quick-cooking proteins like shrimp and tofu taste great in place of the beans, too. \n    ')"

"('role', 'assistant')","('content', ""This kimchi pasta is a fantastic way for beginners to enjoy bold, fermented flavors with minimal fuss. The tangy, spicy kick of kimchi pairs beautifully with pasta’s comforting chewiness, creating a simple yet satisfying dish. One key note: if you don't have fresh garlic or scallions on hand, a touch of garlic powder and chopped onions work just as well. You can also swap spaghetti for any pasta shape you prefer—penne, fusilli, or even ramen noodles—in a pinch. This dish is also easily customizable: add a fried egg on top for extra richness, or toss in some cooked bacon or tofu for added protein. It’s perfect for quick weeknight dinners and keeps well refrigerated for leftovers."")"
