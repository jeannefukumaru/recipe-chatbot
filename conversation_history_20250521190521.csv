Introduction\n    Include a brief evocative introductory paragraph about the recipe that includes possible substitutions and key callouts that the user should know about.\n\n    EXAMPLE INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH:\n    Garlicky, gingery and full of bright flavors, this panacea will heal you from within. The amount of spice is up to you, but know that a little red chile lends immeasurable flavor in addition to heat. If your ginger root is especially young and tender, consider peeling then cutting it into fine 1-inch matchsticks to eat in the soup for an even deeper, punchier warmth. White beans offer protein in this brothy meal, which becomes even heartier with the addition of white rice or noodles. (You can also sop it up with a slice of cornbread.) Reheat this nourishing soup throughout the week, adding more broth and various crisper-drawer vegetables you need to use up, like cabbage, kale, arugula, watercress and bean sprouts. Quick-cooking proteins like shrimp and tofu taste great in place of the beans, too. \n\n    2. Steps\n    Include a numbered list of steps to prepare the recipe. \n\n    EXAMPLE STEPS:\n    # Step 1\n    To a medium pot, add the kimchi, stock, garlic, ginger, gochugaru, fish sauce and doenjang. Set over high heat until boiling. Partially cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and gently boil, stirring occasionally, until the broth is aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes.\n\n    # Step 2\n    Stir in the beans and onion and continue simmering until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed, with salt, gochugaru and fish sauce. Before serving, discard the ginger if you don’t want to eat it and stir in the cilantro.\n\n    3. Tips\n    Include a tips section giving advice on unusual ingredients, substitutions, and ideas for how to repurpose leftovers.\n    \n    EXAMPLE TIPS:\n    Kimchi is sold in many ways and at varying stages of ripeness. For this dish, you want very ripe, well-fermented kimchi for the brightest flavor. Less fermented kimchi will taste like fresh cabbage, whereas well-fermented kimchi will taste sharp and pickled, with small bubbles signaling fermentation. To ferment less ripened kimchi from the store, leave it on the counter in its covered jar at room temperature until it starts to effervesce and smell funky, overnight or up to 48 hours. Return to the refrigerator before using.\n    Reheat this nourishing soup throughout the week, adding more broth and various crisper-drawer vegetables you need to use up, like cabbage, kale, arugula, watercress and bean sprouts.

"('role', 'assistant')","('content', ""A kimchi pasta offers a fantastic fusion of Korean and Italian flavors, delivering a spicy, tangy kick paired with comforting noodles. The beauty of this dish is its versatility—feel free to swap out spaghetti for other pasta shapes like penne or udon, and adjust the amount of kimchi to suit your heat preference. If you don't have fresh garlic or ginger, garlic powder and ground ginger work well. For added richness, consider stirring in a dollop of cream or a sprinkle of cheese toward the end. This dish is perfect for using up leftover kimchi and can be customized with proteins such as bacon, shrimp, or tofu for extra heartiness.\n\n---\n\n### Kimchi Pasta\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain, reserving about 1/2 cup of pasta water.\n\n2. While the pasta cooks, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chopped garlic and ginger, cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute.\n\n3. Stir in chopped kimchi and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through and slightly caramelized, about 3–5 minutes. If using, add a splash of soy sauce or sesame oil for extra depth.\n\n4. Add the drained pasta to the skillet, tossing to combine. If the mixture seems dry, gradually add reserved pasta water until you reach your preferred saucy consistency.\n\n5. Taste and adjust with salt, pepper, or red pepper flakes for more heat. For creaminess, stir in a splash of heavy cream or sprinkle with grated cheese, if desired.\n\n6. Serve immediately, topped with chopped scallions or toasted sesame seeds for garnish.\n\n---\n\n### Tips\n- Kimchi varies from mild to very fermented and tangy. Use a milder, less fermented kimchi if you prefer a subtler flavor, or opt for very ripe, tangy kimchi for a bold punch.\n- Save leftover pasta and kimchi mixture in the fridge for up to 2 days; reheat gently on the stove, adding a splash of pasta water or broth to loosen it.\n- This dish pairs beautifully with grilled meats, fried eggs, or crispy tofu for added protein.\n- For a vegetarian option, skip the cheese or use a plant-based alternative.
