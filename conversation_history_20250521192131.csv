Introduction\n    Include a brief evocative introductory paragraph about the recipe that includes possible substitutions and key callouts that the user should know about.\n\n    EXAMPLE INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH:\n    Garlicky, gingery and full of bright flavors, this panacea will heal you from within. The amount of spice is up to you, but know that a little red chile lends immeasurable flavor in addition to heat. If your ginger root is especially young and tender, consider peeling then cutting it into fine 1-inch matchsticks to eat in the soup for an even deeper, punchier warmth. White beans offer protein in this brothy meal, which becomes even heartier with the addition of white rice or noodles. (You can also sop it up with a slice of cornbread.) Reheat this nourishing soup throughout the week, adding more broth and various crisper-drawer vegetables you need to use up, like cabbage, kale, arugula, watercress and bean sprouts. Quick-cooking proteins like shrimp and tofu taste great in place of the beans, too. \n\n    2. Steps\n    Include a numbered list of steps to prepare the recipe. \n\n    EXAMPLE STEPS:\n    # Step 1\n    To a medium pot, add the kimchi, stock, garlic, ginger, gochugaru, fish sauce and doenjang. Set over high heat until boiling. Partially cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and gently boil, stirring occasionally, until the broth is aromatic, 8 to 10 minutes.\n\n    # Step 2\n    Stir in the beans and onion and continue simmering until warmed through, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings, if needed, with salt, gochugaru and fish sauce. Before serving, discard the ginger if you don’t want to eat it and stir in the cilantro.\n\n    3. Tips\n    Include a tips section giving advice on unusual ingredients, substitutions, and ideas for how to repurpose leftovers.\n    \n    EXAMPLE TIPS:\n    Kimchi is sold in many ways and at varying stages of ripeness. For this dish, you want very ripe, well-fermented kimchi for the brightest flavor. Less fermented kimchi will taste like fresh cabbage, whereas well-fermented kimchi will taste sharp and pickled, with small bubbles signaling fermentation. To ferment less ripened kimchi from the store, leave it on the counter in its covered jar at room temperature until it starts to effervesce and smell funky, overnight or up to 48 hours. Return to the refrigerator before using.\n    Reheat this nourishing soup throughout the week, adding more broth and various crisper-drawer vegetables you need to use up, like cabbage, kale, arugula, watercress and bean sprouts.

"('role', 'assistant')","('content', ""If you're craving the comforting, smoky heat of shakshuka but want to shake things up a bit, I have just the recipe for you. Imagine the rich, tomato-based sauce infused with spices but with an unexpected twist—think roasted red peppers and za'atar, which add depth and a slightly herbaceous note. This dish works beautifully with eggs, but you could also swap in chickpeas or halloumi for a different protein bite. For an extra layer of flavor, sprinkle with fresh herbs like parsley or mint just before serving. If you like heat, a dash of harissa or chili flakes can bring that fiery kick you crave. It’s perfect for brunch, supper, or any time that calls for something warm, vibrant, and a little different from the classic shakshuka.\n\n---\n\n### Roasted Red Pepper and Za'atar Shakshuka\n\n1. **Steps:**\n   # Step 1  \n   Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Toss the red bell peppers with a bit of olive oil, salt, and pepper, then roast on a baking sheet until the skins are charred and the peppers are soft, about 20-25 minutes. Once roasted, transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let cool slightly. Peel off the skins, remove seeds and chop roughly.\n\n   # Step 2  \n   In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add a finely chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in 3 minced garlic cloves and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add 1 teaspoon of smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon of ground cumin, and 1 tablespoon of za'atar, cooking for 30 seconds to toast the spices.\n\n   # Step 3  \n   Pour in 1 can (14 oz) of crushed tomatoes and the roasted red peppers, stirring to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook until the sauce thickens slightly, about 10-15 minutes. Taste and adjust salt, adding a pinch of sugar if the acidity is too sharp.\n\n   # Step 4  \n   Make small wells in the sauce with a spoon, then crack eggs into each well. Cover the skillet and cook until the egg whites are just set but the yolks remain runny, about 5-7 minutes. Sprinkle with fresh herbs, extra za'atar, and a drizzle of olive oil before serving.\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- Roasted red peppers add a sweet smoky flavor, but grilled or jarred peppers can work in a pinch—just drain any excess liquid first.\n- Za'atar varies in flavor; some contain sumac and sesame seeds, which add brightness and nutty notes. Feel free to experiment with your favorite blend.\n- For a vegan version, skip the eggs and top the spicy sauce with crumbled feta or grilled halloumi slices.\n- Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container—reheat gently and serve over toasted bread, pasta, or grain bowls for an easy, flavorful meal."")"

"('role', 'assistant')","('content', 'If you’re looking for a twist on shakshuka that reinvents the classic with new flavors and textures, I’ve got just the recipe for you. Imagine a smoky, spiced tomato sauce— but with a Mediterranean Mediterranean flair— infused with harissa and topped with creamy dollops of labneh or Greek yogurt. Instead of eggs, what about baked, flaky feta or even spicy chorizo slices that lend an entirely different character? You can also add in ingredients like roasted eggplant or zucchini for extra body. This version balances bold heat, tangy dairy, and fragrant herbs, making it both familiar and intriguingly different. Perfect for brunch or a cozy dinner, it invites experimentation—so feel free to swap ingredients based on what you have in the fridge.\n\n---\n\n### Spiced Tomato & Feta Baked Skillet (Shakshuka with a Twist)\n\n1. **Steps:**\n   # Step 1  \n   Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). In an ovenproof skillet or cast-iron pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Sauté 1 chopped onion until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 3 minced garlic cloves and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n   # Step 2  \n   Stir in 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and 1 teaspoon of smoked harissa (adjust to taste for heat). Cook for 1-2 minutes, allowing the flavors to deepen. Add 1 can (14 oz) of crushed tomatoes and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Simmer gently until the sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.\n\n   # Step 3  \n   Gently fold in 1 cup of crumbled feta cheese and chopped fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro. Make a few small wells in the sauce and crack in 2-3 eggs per skillet (or as many as you like), or add sliced chorizo or roasted vegetables for a different protein boost. \n\n   # Step 4  \n   Transfer the skillet to the oven and bake until the eggs are just set, about 8-10 minutes. Remove from the oven, dollop with creamy labneh or Greek yogurt, and sprinkle with additional herbs, sumac, or chili flakes for an extra kick.\n\n---\n\n### Tips:\n- For a vegan twist, omit the eggs and cheese, and instead top with sliced roasted vegetables, tofu crumbles, or olives, finished with a generous dollop of vegan yogurt or tahini.\n- Harissa can be homemade or store-bought; a little goes a long way to give smoky heat. Adjust quantity based on your spice preference.\n- Leftover sauce is excellent stirred into pasta or spooned over toasted bread, making it versatile beyond the skillet.\n- Feel free to swap in other cheeses like burrata or goat cheese, or add roasted eggplant for a heartier, vegetable-forward option.')"
